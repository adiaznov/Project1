# Soccer Player Stats Analysis (2021-2022 Season)

## Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and a **Nonparametric Inference Simulation** on player statistics from the 2021-2022 European Top 5 Soccer Leagues. The analysis covers goals scored, passing accuracy, and bootstrapped median estimation.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Football Reference / Kaggle (2021-2022 Top 5 European Leagues)
- **Features**: Goals, Assists, Minutes Played, Pass Completion %, and more.

## Objective
To explore player performance using statistical visualization and simulate a bootstrap estimation of the median number of goals scored.

## Methods
- **Data Wrangling** with Pandas and Numpy
- **Exploratory Visualization** with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **Bootstrapping** for median inference
- **Random Sampling** (10% of data)
